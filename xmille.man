.TH XMILLE 6 "April 1992" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xmille \- X window mille bourne game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmille
.RI [ restore-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xmille
brings up a window for a mille bournes game.
When selecting one of your cards, the left button plays the card,
the right button discards the card and the middle button chooses
whichever is appropriate, first trying to play the card, and then
discarding it.
.br
For those who don't know, the point behind
.I mille bournes
is to get to 700 miles before your opponent.  You can opt for an extension,
and for extra points go the full 1000 (mille) miles (bournes).  You must
get exactly the correct number of miles.
.br
You can try
and stop your opponent with various "battle" cards.  It will try and stop
you.  You can counter the "battle" cards with the appropriate gasoline,
repair, Go, or spare tire card.  Or you may have a "Safety", with will
make it impossible for your opponent to hurt you in some fashion.  It's
a good idea to keep your Safety's in your hand (unless your opponent
gets close to the end).  If your opponent, say, hands you an "out of gas"
card and you have the Tanker truck card, you play it immediately and
cry out, "Coup Fourre'!!"
(pronounced, "KOO four RAY")  You get bonus points for that.  For
full game rules, see the Parker Brothers card game by the same name.
.br
There are now keyboard equivalents for some of the actions:
.nf
p  - Pick a card
u# - use card number "#"  (1-6)
up - use picked card
d# - discard card number "#" (1-6)
dp - discard picked card
Q  - absolute Quit, doesn't check with you before doing so.
s  - save game

.SH BUGS
It does not accept any X arguments, including the -display argument.  The
DISPLAY environment variable must be set for it to work

Sometimes it crashes if you win :-(.  I need to look into it further.
If you can reproduce it on a regular basis, or if you can figure it out, 
that would be great! -Mike, 3/28/96
